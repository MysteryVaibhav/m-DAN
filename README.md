# m-DAN: Dual Attention Networks for Multimodal Reasoning and Matching
Implement current SOTA model for image text matching task. Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00471

To train a model: 
```
python main.py --mode 0
```

To test a model, make sure the model file is under models folder. 

```
python main.py --mode 1 --model_file_name model_weights_1.t7
```
